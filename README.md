# Players Tracking
- we are trying to perform players tracking using detection and tracking modules with highest accuarcy
# Overview
- There are different models with its inference code and results of each one :  
*Note: Order is from lowest to highest performance and accuracy*
    - UNITRACK : [Original Rep Link](https://github.com/Zhongdao/UniTrack)
    - BYTE TRACK : [Original Rep Link](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack)
    - OC-SORT : [Original Rep Link](https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT)
    - Bird's Eye View : [Original Rep Link](https://github.com/FootballAnalysis/footballanalysis/tree/main/Bird's%20eye%20view)
