# FP-SR-Clothes
- Task is performing SR(Super-Resolution) For Images, Especially Faces and Clothes
- Presentation Video : [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gWyugM4O0ivmrjlcv3UO0rEpc8oe_8Qn/view?usp=sharing)
- we use two models to perform SR :
    1. RealESRGAN for Clothes Restoration : [Original Repo](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
    2. GFPGAN for Faces Restoration : [Original Repo](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN)
- we apply each model on degraded image then paste restored face from GFPGAN model to restored image from Real-ESRGAN Model
